# Covfefe

Author: Anna Li

Design: You're an intern fresh out of freshman year of college, with a burning desire to leave a good impression on your boss. Your first task is a simple one: bring her a cup of coffee ASAP.

How To Play:

Use the WASD keys to move and the mouse to change the camera view. Your goal is to quickly get from one corner of the office to the other, where your boss (in yellow) awaits her hot coffee.
(Hint: Those doors look kinda sussy, don't they?)
